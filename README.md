# Mudek Survey Analyzer

This is a program used for analyzing survey results about courses given in a university. The surveys are created as Google Forms and the program downloads the results as CSV files. Then it creates PDF results and these results can be sent to the lecturer via email.

Mudek is short for "Muhendislik Egitim Programlari Degerlendirme ve Akreditasyon Dernegi" (Association for Evaluating and Accreditation of Engineering Programs). It is an association which evaluates engineering programs in Turkey. The course surveys are one of their requirements.
